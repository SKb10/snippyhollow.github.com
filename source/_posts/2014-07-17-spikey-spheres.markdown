Just a quick blog post to say that if you didn't read ["Spikey Spheres"](http://www.penzba.co.uk/cgi-bin/PvsNP.py?SpikeySpheres) before, you should. And [there is my IPython notebook that goes with it](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/gist.github.com/SnippyHolloW/9025964/raw/b2d266e7e19d64e0343fd899dfbc3e8ddc889269/SpikeySpheres?create=1). There is also [this connection with the central limit theorem](http://djalil.chafai.net/blog/2013/07/14/a-cube-a-starfish-a-thin-shell-and-the-central-limit-theorem/) (and the $l^{\infty}$ ball).
