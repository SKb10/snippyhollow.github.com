Quite some time ago (when I was coding some of this myself for educational purposes), I made a diagram of the succesive transformations that are applied to "raw" (wave files) audio for a classic speech recognition pipeline. I think sharing it would be interesting to some of you, pay close attention to the X-axis labels, and you shouldn't get lost!
